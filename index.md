# Professional Projects

I've worked with the ACT Government (a municipal/state government in Australia) since 2014.
I've been involved in the development of numerous web applications, including:

- ACS - A high school student certification system used by the Board of Studies
- Application Portfolio Management (APM) - A bespoke AngularJS web application that integrates with ServiceNow and allows users to manage their business applications
- Numerous other web applications (excursion booking, professional learning calendar, etc)
- A bespoke data synchronisation application that integrates Avoka Transact Manager smart forms with existing school databases

These web applications make use of the following technology stack:

- The .NET framework (numerous versions)
- ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET WebForms
- ASP.NET Web API
- Microsoft SQL Server database (2008 R2 and later)
- Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
- Microsoft Windows Server
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- NCache

And speaking of ServiceNow, I'm also occasionally involved in the administration of that system.
This includes occasional integration work (such as the aforementioned APM web application) and 
report creation for users of the system.
I also created a suite of specialised SSRS reports that run against the ServiceNow database.
