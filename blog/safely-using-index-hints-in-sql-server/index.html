                <h1>Safely using index hints in SQL Server</h1>
            </header>

            <p>
                I've been fortunate enough to attend Brent Ozar's Fundamentals and Mastering classes over the last 8
                months or so.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've watched most of them now, and they're excellent. Brent is a great instructor in my
                opinion. He keeps viewers engaged and interested with humour and sharp wit. But it's the content itself
                that is outstanding in its quality. Everything is coherent and delivered in the right place at the right
                time. I suspect Brent has agonised a great deal over perfecting the structure, content, and delivery.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the courses, Mastering Parameter Sniffing, covers some clever ways to tune queries while avoiding
                index hints that refer to named indexes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason given for avoiding index hints is a simple one: Queries with prescriptive index hints fail if
                anything compromises the index.
            </p>

            <h2>The problem with naming indexes in index hints</h2>

            <p>
                The following example showcases the problem. Imagine that a well-meaning database administrator has
                renamed the index so that it's clearer which table the index belongs to.
            </p>

            <pre><code>create table MyTable (
	Id int not null,
	Column1 int null,
	constraint PK primary key (Id),
	index IDX1 unique nonclustered (Column1)
);

select Id
from MyTable with (forceseek (IDX1 (Column1)))
where
	Column1 = 1;

exec sp_rename N'dbo.MyTable.IDX1', N'MyTable_IDX1', 'index';

select Id
from MyTable with (forceseek (IDX1 (Column1)))
where
	Column1 = 1;</code></pre>

            <p>
                The first execution of the <code>SELECT</code> query succeeds. The index named in the
                <code>FORCESEEK</code> hint exists, and its key columns are ordered in such a way that SQL Server can
                satisfy the query using a seek operation on the specified index.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second execution after the rename isn't so lucky, and we get the following error:
            </p>

            <pre><code>Msg 308, Level 16, State 1, Line 24
Index 'IDX1' on table 'MyTable' (specified in the FROM clause) does not exist.</code></pre>

            <p>
                Oops.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, renaming the index isn't the only form of misadventure. There are two other scenarios
                that might play out.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The index might be dropped.</li>
                <li>
                    The index might be created anew, with the key columns ordered differently or otherwise changed in
                    such a way that SQL Server can no longer execute the query pursuant to the prescription.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Brent isn't the only one with this concern. I have colleagues who have the same concerns, and I think
                they're totally reasonable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Having said that, the alternatives that Brent showcases in his course are designed to work on a single
                database. The reason for this is that they marry elements of the schema (i.e., a query in this case) to
                elements of the data (e.g.: a given outlier value that is the content stored within that schema).
            </p>

            <p>
                This looks something like:
            </p>

            <pre><code>create procedure MyProcedure
	@Column1 int
as
begin
	select top 100 *
	from MyTable
	where
		Column1 = @Column1
	option (optimize for (@Column1 = 1));
end</code></pre>

            <p>
                In the example, the query - which is inextricably tied to the underlying schema - features the literal
                value <code>1</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In essence, we have just elevated a part of the data so that it is now a part
                of the schema. I like to think of it as a case of the tail wagging the dog.
            </p>

            <p>
                This approach can work quite well in a database that is mature in terms of the shape of the data
                (i.e., it has well-known outlier values, and these values will very likely remain as outliers into the
                future, and these values are prominent within the statistics that are generated for the table).
            </p>

            <p>
                However, the company I work for runs sharded multi-tenant databases.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm sure you could still adapt the approach to a sharded multi-tenant database environment. Maybe you'd
                use code generation at run-time (i.e., dynamic SQL) to create your stored procedures (if you're using
                stored procedures). In fact, Brent mentions that someone - <a
                    href="https://sqlbits.com/speakers/Guy_Glantser">Guy Glantser</a> - has done just that with a view
                to achieving better query plan estimates in spite of the limitations of SQL Server's statistics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, if you're working with tools like <code>sqlpackage.exe</code> then runtime code
                generation of the sort mentioned would pose its own logistical challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
                But what if you could just protect your indexes and ensure their conformance instead?
            </p>

            <h2>Protecting your indexes</h2>

            <p>
                Let's jump straight into the code. The script that follows is idempotent, so you can run it and re-run
                it multiple times safely. It will create a new SQL Server database named '<code>Experiment</code>' that
                contains all necessary database objects. The script concludes with a number of test cases that
                demonstrate how the indexes are protected.
            </p>

            <p>
                The code above relies on several key objects:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A stored procedure named <code>DBA.EnsureIndexes</code>.</li>
                <li>
                    A database trigger named <code>IndexProtection</code> executes the stored procedure when an index is
                    created, dropped, or an object is renamed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Two tables - <code>DBA.DesiredIndex</code> and <code>DBA.DesiredIndexColumn</code> - which contain
                    data describing the desired state of our indexes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                When executed, the stored procedure examines SQL Server's metadata catalogues along with the desired
                state and, in the event that the indexes described by the metadata are deemed non-conformant, throws an
                exception.
            </p>

            <p>
                This works because the database trigger runs within the context of the Data Definition Language (DDL)
                statement that is modifying the index.
                Throwing an exception leads to the rolling back of that statement as SQL Server's DDL statements are
                transactional.
            </p>

            <p>
                There might be a few 'gotchas', and if you intend to use the code then you should test it to ensure that
                it is fit for purpose in your specific environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, the <code>sqlpackage.exe</code> tool's <code>publish</code> command will disable and later
                re-enable DDL triggers such as the one in the code above. So you'll need to specify a value of
                <code>False</code> for the <code>DisableAndReenableDdlTriggers</code> parameter. Otherwise, you'll find
                that the protection mechanism is essentially disarmed every time you use <code>sqlpackage</code> to
                perform a DACPAC release.
            </p>

            <p>
