                <h1>Reliable SQL Server timestamps</h1>
            </header>

            <p>Reliable timestamps are a challenge.</p>

            <p>
                If their value is managed in client application code then there's the risk that they are not updated
                alongside other columns.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example:
            </p>

            <pre><code>UPDATE MyTable
   SET Column1 = 'Some value',
       /* UpdatedDtm = GETUTCDATE(), */ /* OMITTED */
       Column2 = 123
 WHERE Id = 123;</code></pre>

            <p>
                They might also be essential for the proper functioning of the application.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lost update anomaly prevention underpinned by a timestamp will only function correctly when the
                timestamp is reliable.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the timestamp is unreliable then a change performed by User A might subsequently be clobbered by User
                B, with User B left blissfully unaware that they've done so.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider the following transactions, where User 1 and User 2 both read some data for the same 'thing'
                and intend to update it.
            </p>

            <pre><code>/*
Transaction #1 at Time #1
User 1 reads data
*/
SELECT Content, UpdatedDtm
  FROM MyTable
 WHERE Id = 123;

/*
Transaction #2 at Time #1
User 2 reads data
*/
SELECT Content, UpdatedDtm
  FROM MyTable
 WHERE Id = 123;

/* A few hours later */

/*
Transaction #3 at Time #2

User 1 saves their changes to the database.

The version of the application that they
are using contains a bug.
Unfortunately the timestamp column is not
updated along with the rest of the columns.

The update succeeds, as no other changes
have been made.
The timestamp column still contains the
old value: '2022-10-18 09:00:00'
*/
UPDATE MyTable
   SET Content = 'Hours of wasted work'
 WHERE Id = 123
   AND UpdatedDtm = '2022-10-18 09:00:00';

/*
Transaction #4 at Time #3

User 2 saves their changes to the database.

User 2 is using an updated version of the
application.
The aforementioned bug has been fixed.

The update succeeds, even though it should
not have.

The lost update anomaly prevention has
failed due to the aforementioned bug.

User 1's work has been lost.
*/
UPDATE MyTable
   SET Content = 'Something',
       UpdatedDtm = '2022-10-18 11:30:00'
 WHERE Id = 123
   AND UpdatedDtm = '2022-10-18 09:00:00';</code></pre>

            <p>
                Faced with this challenge, many people will reach for triggers as a foolproof solution. And triggers can
                work.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, triggers have their own issues.
            </p>

            <p>
                Perhaps the biggest issue is that they're imperative rather than declarative, and more likely subject to
                programmer error as a result.
            </p>

            <p>
                They're also often maligned as a cause of poor database performance. However it's worth noting that this
                is often due to suboptimal code such as the RBAR (row-by-agonising-row, cursor-based) approach to
                handling multiple rows.
            </p>

            <p>
                So let's create an alternative pit of success. We'll do it declaratively using the ROWVERSION column
                type.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's the table DDL:
            </p>

            <pre><code>CREATE TABLE MyTable (
  Id INT NOT NULL,
  Content NVARCHAR(2000) NOT NULL,
  RVBinary ROWVERSION NOT NULL,
  RV AS ISNULL(CONVERT(BIGINT, RVBinary), 0) PERSISTED
);</code></pre>

            <p>
                And that's it.
            </p>

            <p>
                The RV column, a computed column, exists for more convenient interoperability with application code.
                Working with a value of type long in a language like C# is easier than working with a value of type
                byte[] (byte array) of length 8.
            </p>

            <p>
                The RV column is PERSISTED so that it exists in the table data on disk, instead of being computed every
                time the data is read. This isn't strictly necessary, but consider that databases are almost always
                read-heavy.
                By specifying PERSISTED we are choosing to pay the penalty on writes instead of reads.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, the RV column definition contains a CONVERT(...) invocation wrapped in an ISNULL(...)
                invocation.
            </p>

            <p>
                We as humans have a priori knowledge of the fact that RV is a non-null column. We know that RVBinary is
                a non-null column, and that it logically follows that RV will also be non-null in this situation.
            </p>

            <p>
                However SQL Server doesn't know this, and its metadata will indicate that the RV column is nullable. The
                call to ISNULL(...) clarifies this, making SQL Server aware of the fact that the column will contain no
                null values.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's talk about drawbacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main drawback here is that we're now dealing with an arbitrary ROWVERSION value, instead of a
                DATETIME2 value as was used in the original example.
            </p>

            <p>
                We know that a row with a higher ROWVERSION value was modified later than a row with a lower ROWVERSION
                value, but we cannot correlate these arbitrary values with a time of day.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you need to capture the date and time that a record was last updated then consider using both
                approaches side-by-side.
            </p>

            <p>
                Use the ROWVERSION column (or the computed RV column) for the important stuff such as lost update
                anomaly prevention and anything else requiring robust ordering of row modifications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Use the perhaps-haphazardly updated DATETIME2 column for matters concerning the display of information.
            </p>
